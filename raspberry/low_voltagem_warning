# Raspberry Pi 5 – Power & USB Current Management

This repository documents how power and USB current management work on the Raspberry Pi 5,
based strictly on official Raspberry Pi documentation and best practices.

It provides both a practical tutorial and technical background on:
- Avoiding undervoltage warnings
- Enabling maximum USB current safely
- Monitoring power and throttling states
- Understanding EEPROM power policies

⚠️ No undocumented or unsafe power-forcing methods are used.

## Overview

The Raspberry Pi 5 introduces a stricter and more advanced power management system compared
to previous models. Power delivery is negotiated via USB-C Power Delivery (PD), and firmware
dynamically manages current distribution between:

- CPU / GPU
- USB ports
- Connected peripherals

If the power supply does not correctly negotiate the expected PD profile, the system may:
- Limit USB port current
- Display undervoltage warnings
- Trigger throttling events

---

## Recommended Power Supply

- 5 V ⎓ 5 A (25–27 W)
- USB-C Power Delivery compliant
- USB-C cable rated for 5 A

The official Raspberry Pi power supply is strongly recommended.

## Quick Start

Enable maximum USB current (when the power supply allows it).

Edit configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
